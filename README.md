# Friday Night Funkin': NULL Engine
***DISCLAIMER: This is engine is still missing a few features from the base game. They will be added overtime. No .lua or .hxscript support will be added to this engine.***

A fork of [Nova Engine](https://github.com/The-Coders-Den/NovaEngine-Godot-FNF) continuing where the original developers left off while adding new features.
## Features
- V-Slice Song Files Support | NULL Engine can load any V-Slice song without issues.
- HUD Editor | Customize the look of the in-game HUD. **NOTE: This feature is currently missing in V1.1.0 and will return with the V1.2.0 Update!**
- Mod Loader | Mods can be loaded with the built-in Mod Loader. Mods have to be created with the engine itself and then exported as a *.pck file.
## How to use
Because NULL Engine is made with the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org), specifically [Godot 4.4.1](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.4.1-stable), you'll have to download that to use. Once you have Godot and NULL Engine's source code open up Godot and import NULL Engine's project.godot file.

Modding documentation will be added over the course of time to the [GitHub's Wiki Page](https://github.com/NullifiedAce/NULLEngine/wiki).
